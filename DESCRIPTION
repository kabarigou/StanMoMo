Description: The StanMoMo package performs Bayesian Mortality Modeling with Stan for a variety of popular mortality models. The current package supports the Lee-Carter (LC) model, 
    the Renshaw-Haberman model (LC with cohort effect), the Age-Period-Cohort (APC) model, the Cairns-Blake-Dowd (CBD) model and the M6 model (CBD with cohort effect). By a simple call, 
    the user inputs deaths and exposures and the package outputs the MCMC simulations for each parameter, the log likelihoods and predictions. Moreover, the package includes tools for model selection and 
    Bayesian model averaging by leave future-out validation.
